# Introduction
This is just a skelly code which requires to be constructed in many ways, I believe there is no singular way to code, but there are also codes that are deeply thought about how it will be delivered. 

So, these project are meant to be show a little bit of how you handle your work, which is more crucial from your perspective given by other rules that apply.

> If you need to download prerequisites like dependencies, gradle or anything, you should tell other person about it. If you were given a time limit by them, as I haven't found a better way to do this yet.

## Objective
There are a lot of options here, but the main goal is to construct ListFragment by yourself, do what's best with (presumably) your time constraints, keep it clean, but also use all your knowledge.

The main goal is to make caching, endless, shared, database operation and also navigation between list fragment and detail fragment from scratch. This is a lot of work, so it is perfectly fine not to achieve all of these goals.

How this will play out is up to you, how you want to present yourself as a personality.
